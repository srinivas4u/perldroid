# Introduction #

The term « PerlDroid » is the name that the application had on the [Android platform](http://code.google.com/intl/fr/android/).

Now that I gave up implementing bindings, this project only keeps ways to [cross compile perl](Compiling5160.md) for the Android platform, and is meant to provide the [perl-android-apk](http://code.google.com/p/perl-android-apk/) project with a perl executable (with all core modules \o/).

# Details about the name #

This name was chosen simply by concatenating the word [Perl](Perl.md) and [Android](Android.md) and eluding the beginning of the word Android. It is simple and easy to remember. If you have lost the URL of this project, search for « perl » and « android » on Google Code Search, as they are tags of this project.
