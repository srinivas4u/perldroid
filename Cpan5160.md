# How to compile CPAN EUMM and MB modules for Android #

Follow these steps to build CPAN EUMM modules with the project as it is today (2012-07-09). MB modules can be built too.

This procedure **needs an already cross compiled perl**. Please refer to [Compiling5160](Compiling5160.md) to know how to do it.

  1. Change directory to Cross in SVN and prepare cross compilation
```
cd ~/perldroid/libperl/perl-5.16.0/Cross
./prepare_perl_for_cpan.sh 
```
  1. Change directory to cross compiled perl and execute the provided `cpan.android` script (example installs JSON.pm, asking if you wish to install JSON::XS too)
```
cd ~/perl-arm-5.16.0-14
PATH=$PATH:~/perl-arm-5.16.0-14
./cpan.android JSON
```

You can pass more than one module to install, the script will resolve dependencies for you. The resulting modules are installed in `~/cpan_android.<arch>-<perl-version>-<android-version>/`, in this case `~/cpan_android.arm-5.16.0-14`.

**N.B.:** There is no `make test` executed because, of course, host can't load built shared libraries.

Have fun!
