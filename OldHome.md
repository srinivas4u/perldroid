# Details #

The « PerlDroid » application will be able to download and install Perl modules (core modules at minima) specially built for it.

Applications written in Perl will be packaged as separate Android application with a bootstrap in Java. This bootstrap will be auto-generated with a tool.

# Infos #

I've put my experiments on the pages http://gtmp.org/publications:perl-on-android and http://gtmp.org/publications:perl-on-android-2 . Take a look at them if you are interested.

For the moment, the source in SVN is able to display a simple Activity and create and display a Dialog box with callbacks. See [Compiling](Compiling.md).

I've translated the « Snake » example to Perl, and now I'm trying to make it work.

# What's going on? #

This project is changing continuously. It is pre-alpha so don't expect much of it for the moment. See DotPlan -- Now see [Issue Tracker](http://code.google.com/p/perldroid/issues/list) for this.
